# Brand — Perps Platform

_Status: deferred_

The user chose to defer brand setup. This project is currently using shadcn's default neutral palette mapped to the existing dark exchange theme (green/red accents). The `frontend-design-guidelines` skill will quietly use defaults and will not prompt again.

To set up a real brand palette, typography, and voice at any time, run:

    /brand-design

or say: "pick brand colors"

When `brand-design` runs, it will detect this deferred state, skip the "confirm overwrite" step, and proceed directly to the full brand setup. The resulting palette will be applied to CSS variables and this file will be replaced with the real brand documentation.
